services and other initiatives and programmes to provide climate information to stake holders and the general public has been made over the recent decades (e.g. the WMO global framework for climate services (GFCS), the CORDEX program, and the Joint Programming Initiative (JPI-Climate)). The urgency of their mission has been emphasised by recent extreme weather events and the publication of a number of climate research reports (e.g. Hov et al. (2013); Field et al. (2012); Stocker et al. (2013)). The development of efficient and versatile tools for climate analysis are essential to this effort. For instance, there is always a need for extracting relevant climate information, reading data, and testing and visualising the results. The present ‘esd’ tool has been developed to meet these requirements. The ‘esd’ tool is being used in different projects such as FP7 SPECS and CLIPC1, COST-VALUE2, INDICE3, CixPAG4, MIST-II 5, CLIMATRANS6, and EU-CIRCLE 7 to establish networks and standards for assessment and validation of model results needed for climate services.</p> <h2 id="motivation"> <a href="#motivation" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="motivation"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Motivation </h2> <p>Open, efficient, flexible, and intuitive tools making use of state-of-the-art statistical know-how have long been needed for the purpose of climate analysis. Often the lack of resources (man power) dedicated to such work limits the possibilities of offering tailor-made user-relevant information. There is a wide range of requirements, from climate data handling and analysis, and validation/diagnostics to bias adjustment of model results and downscaling (including predic- tion and projection). Even if the main purpose may be just to carry out empirical-statistical downscaling (ESD; Benestad et al. (2008)), many other tasks are necessary to prepare the analysis and understand the results. The need to analyse multi-model ensembles rather than single model (Benestad , 2011) also makes additional demands on the tools. In other words, ‘esd’ is a tools for ’Big data’ climate analysis.</p> <div class="table-wrapper"><table> <tbody> <tr> <td>CLIPC</td> <td>Provides access to climate information of direct relevance to a wide variety of users, from scientists to policy makers and private sector decision makers.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>COST Action VALUE (2012-2015)</td> <td>Aims at providing a European network to develop downscaling methods, validate them, and improve the collaboration between the research communities and stakeholders.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>INDICE</td> <td>Is a collaboration between Norway and India that studies the hydrological consequences of climate change on the Hindu-Kush region in Himalaya</td> </tr> <tr> <td>CiXPAG</td> <td>Aims at investigating the complex interactions between climate extremes, air pollution and agricultural ecosystems.

Although model results are meant to be provided in a standard format (e.g. the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project8 - CMIP - following the ‘Climate and Forecast’ (CF) convention), experience shows that there are often differences that can cause problems. For instance, the CMIP5 ensemble of models involves 4 different types of calendars. Data files are often organised in accordance with some kind of Common Information Model9 (CIM) or a Data Reference Syntax10 (DRS), but there is also a benefit in standard structures in the working computer memory when using programming environments such as R. A well-defined and standardised data structure makes it possible to create a generic climate analysis tool. Searching for available and complete observational data sets is always a difficult and time consuming task without prior knowledge about the quality of the retrieved data sets. In the context of empirical-statistical downscaling, observations are needed both for validation of model results and for calibrating models. Furthermore, there may be a need to aggregate annual mean values rather than daily or monthly, and to extract subsets, for instance a given calendar month, a limited interval, or a smaller spatial region. The purpose of the ‘esd’ package is to offer an R-package that covers as many as possible of these requirements, from acquiring data and converting to a standardised format, to performing various statistical analyses, including statistical downscaling, all in a simple and user-friendly way.</p> <h2 id="history"> <a href="#history" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="history"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> History </h2> <p>Most of the previous work on ESD carried out at MET Norway has been based on the R-package ‘clim.pact’ (Benestad et al., 2008) from the early 2000s. This tool had evolved into a large set of methods and functions over time, but without a ‘strict discipline’. Hence, the functions would use a range of different set-ups and lacked a streamlined finish. Therefore, it was not very user friendly. The idea is that any climate data analysis should be quick, easy, and efficient, with a bare minimum effort going into coding and reformatting of data sets. It should be intuitive and easy to remember how to perform the analysis. This way, more of the time can be devoted to do the analysis itself and writing reports, rather than rewriting code, debugging, testing, and verifying the process. While much of the methods needed in climate analysis were included in ‘clim.pact’, it was evident that the most efficient solution was to create a new R-package from scratch with a more purposeful and well-defined data structure. Much of the methods, however, are based on functions in ‘clim.pact’, although the benefit of experience from developing that package has been utilised from the start of the creation of ‘esd’. 8http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ 9https://www.earthsystemcog.org/projects/downscalingmetadata/ 10http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/output_req.html</p> <p>Since it is creation, the ‘clim.pact’ package has been widely used by the climate community for research purposes and has been a valuable asset for assessment studies (Winkler et al., 2011). For instance, Spak et al. (2007) compared statistical and dynamical downscaling of surface temperature in North America using results obtained from the ‘clim.pact’ tool, and Girma et al. (2010) used the ‘clim.pact’ tool to downscale rainfall in the upper Blue Nile basin for hydrological modelling. The R-package was used by Sch¨oner and Cardoso (2005) to downscale air temperature mean and precipitation sums from regional model as well as directly from ERA-40 fields, and Tyler et al. (2007) used it to produce temperature scenarios by downscaling output from 17 different global climate. However, Estrada et al. (2013) pointed out that ‘clim.pact’ and similar tools do not provide the necessary tests to ensure the statistical adequacy of the model and therefore misleading results could be expected. We will address some of the issues that Estrada et al. (2013) highlighted later on.</p> <h2 id="the-new-tool-esd"> <a href="#the-new-tool-esd" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="the-new-tool-esd"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> The new tool: ‘esd’ </h2> <p>The new tool ‘esd’, like its predecessor ‘clim.pact’, is based on a ‘plug-and-play Lego principle’, where data are seen as an object that is used as input and new results are returned as output following a standard data structure. This means that different functionalities can be combined where the output from one process is used as input to the next. In ‘esd’ the data structure has changed from that in ‘clim.pact’, and uses more attributes and less list objects. Furthermore, the data objects build on the time series object ‘zoo’, which takes care of much of the chronology. A consequence of using ‘zoo’ as a basis also is that it implies adopting S3-methods, which also makes the tool more flexible and user-friendly. Through the S3-methods, new plotting methods have been made available for station and field objects, empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), and other types. The use of S3-methods implies the definition of new classes describing the data types. It can also make the tool work more seamlessly with other R-packages and other structures if appropriate conversion tools are made. The development of the ‘esd’ software fits in with the trend of the R-language’s increasing role in the climate change debate (Pocernich, 2003) and as an open science platform (Pebesma et al., 2012). Furthermore, both R and the ‘esd’ R-package are valuable tools for linking high education and research (IBARRA-BERASTEGI et al.). The ‘esd’-package has already been used as material for capacity building in connection with the bilateral INDICE project between Norway and India (http://www.nve.no/en/Projects/INDICE/), and the CHASE-PL project between Norway and Poland (http://www.isrl.poznan.pl/chase/index.php/project/). The wide range of functionalities included in the ‘esd’ tool makes it suitable for processing results from global and regional models. The tool also includes methods for plotting and generating various info-graphics: time series, maps, and visualisation of complex information.</p> <p>The data processing aspects include re-gridding, sub-setting, transformations, computing empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) and principal component analysis (PCA) for stations and gridded data on (ir)regular grids, regression, empirical-statistical downscaling, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and multi-variate regression (MVR). The tool also offers several diagnostic methods for quality assessment of the data and downscaled results. The ‘esd’ methods can be tailored to meet with specific user needs and requirements. As the library was built for the R computing environment (R Core Team, 2014), it inherits from the large number of R built-in functions and procedures. It also includes an additional set of predefined objects and classes, sample and structured data and meta-data, and uses the S3-methods to ensure that information is appropriately maintained. Finally, the ‘esd’ library has been built with the emphasis of traceability, compatibility, and transparency of the data, methods, procedures, and results, and is made freely available for use by the climate community and can be installed from the MET Norway Github account (https://github.com/metno/esd) or Figshare (http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1160493). The remainder of this report describes technical issues related to the ‘esd’ tool. A listing of the syntax and examples are also included in this report.</p> </div> </div> <div class="search-overlay"></div> </div> </body> </html>
