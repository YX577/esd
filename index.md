## esd R tool

We present a tool, the R-package‘esd’, made freely available by the Norwegian MeteorologicalInstitute (MET Norway) for use by the climate community that: 
 - was primarily built for empirical-statistical downscaling of climate information and has been extended to search, process, dissect,and analyse meteorological and climatological data (localas well as global climate data sets).  
 - consists of i) retrieving and manipulating large samples ofmeteorological, climate and model datafrom various sources, ii) searching, dissecting and displaying the information in the data, (iii) andcomputing a range of analyses. The acronym‘esd’can be associated with both ‘Easy & SimpleData’ processing and ‘Empirical-Statistical downscaling’. 
 - provides simple and intuitive ways forreading data from weather station, gridded data sets, as well as trajectory data such as cyclonepaths. 

The philosophy behind its design has been to reduce the time spent on coding, reformattingdata, testing the code, or looking up the manuals for correctsyntax. The functions are designed tobe intuitive and easy to remember in addition to being efficient.
